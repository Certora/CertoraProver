Create an external 'harness contract' which provides a minimal way to execute the given 'internal' Solidity function
via an external function wrapper.
The external function wrapper should simply pass its arguments to the internal function, and return the result back
to the caller. The internal function being harnessed
should be included in the contract. You MAY include extra type definitions, but only if absolutely necessary for the
code to compile; definitions solely for documentation or explanation
purposes should NOT be included.
The external harness should be type correct and syntax correct. To ensure this, use the Solidity compiler tool and
incorporate its feedback to fix any type/syntax errors.
