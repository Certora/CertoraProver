The following code is the result of an LLM simplifying some complicated
Solidity code with the goal of making it more amenable for a static pointer analysis.
The static analysis works well on standard Solidity code, but struggles with
inline assembly, non-standard memory layouts, etc.

When simplifying the code, the LLM was given the following constraints:
```
{% include "rewrite_constraints.j2" %}
```
and
```
{% include "code_requirements.j2" %}
```

Analyze the rewrite for its adherence to the above requirements.
Phrase all feedback in the second person, addressing the LLM that generated
this code. For example, say "instead of doing X you should ..."
