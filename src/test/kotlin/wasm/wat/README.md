# Generating textual WebAssemble from Kotlin code

The `wasm.wat` package contains a Kotlin DSL for generating textual WebAssembly code.  The idea is to present all
(or at least most) WebAssembly instructions in a way that is easy to read and write in Kotlin, and to facilitate
high-level wasm test code generation.

For usage, see [WatSamples.kt](WatSamples.kt).
