                 *
                 * However, there are two reasons why we do this, and they are both due to how packed storage arrays are copied.
                 * Suppose you are copying `uint64[]` which has 4 per storage slot.
                 * Solidity copies from storage until there are fewer than 4 elements left. Let `elemCounter` be
                 * the number of elements copied so far. It then generates this:
                 * ```
                 * if(elemCounter < length) {

                 *    elemCounter++
                 * }
                 * ```
                 * This shows both reasons. The first: that final `if(elemCounter < length)` check is *always* false.
                 * If we use `unsat` to infer what size elements we are looking at, and we have an always infeasible static path,
                 * then we will get spurious failures because given we're effectively assuming false, element size could
                 * be 1 and 32 at the same time, why not?
                 *
                 * The other problem is with the structure here. If the first condition is false, all the remaining
                 * conditions will be false, so we have to prune the paths where we try to enter the later conditionals
                 * we'll get a statically infeasible path again.
                 *
                 * As an aside, if we enumerate all paths, we get 16 possible paths, of which only *4*
                 * are possible (for 0 remaining elems, 1 remaining elem, etc.) so there are performance reasons to prune
                 * early (although we need to actually generate sub problems).
                 *
                 * For these reasons, we always check if the path condition is infeasible. To do this, we simply fork
                 * the script, and check satisfiability. If we get unsat, the path conditions (and program definitions)
