/**
 * Adds a havoc command at the beginning of the root block for every variable that is used somewhere that it may
 * be uninitialized.
 *
 * This includes cases such as:
 * ```
 *    block0:
 *      jump to block1 or block2
 *
 *    block1:
 *      x := something
 *      jump to block3
 *
 *    block2:
 *      jump to block3
 *
 *    block3:
 *      use x on the rhs.
 * ```
 *
 * We consider any appearance of a variable as a usage (even if it appears only in some meta or annotation).
 * Variables of type `Tag.CVLArray` shouldn't appear at this point in the program (and adding a havoc statement for
 * them crashes the tool), but they do, for some reason appear in some metas. We therefore ignore such variables.
