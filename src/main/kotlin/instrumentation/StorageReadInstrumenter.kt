/**
 * Instrument programs to assume that storage locations that are dead must be zero.
 *
 * We effect this by associating with each map typed storage variable with a
 * read tracking map variable. Let the storage variable be called m, and denote
 * the read tracker as m$r. We have the following invariant:
 * for any `k`, if `m$r[k] != 0` then `m[k]` has been read, and vice versa.
 * In other words, we dynamically track which keys in `m` have been read by setting the
 * corresponding location in `m$r` to 1. At rule initialization, we set `m$r` to be all zeroes,
 * and `m$r` becomes part of the storage state which is backed-up/restored with reverts.
 *
 * The association of `m` with `m$r` is done in the [readTracking] field:
 * the domain are the storage variables (`m`), and the codomain, if non-null is the corresponding read tracking
 * variable `m$r`.
 *
 * The instrumentation works as follows:
 * For any read of `m[k]` with a corresponding `m$r` we add `m$r[k] = 1` immediately following the read, indicating
 * that the word load is live.
 *
 * At a store to `m[k]` with a corresponding `m$r` we read the previous value of `m[k]` and the value of `m$r[k]`. We
 * then assume `m$r[k] != 0 || m[k] == 0` aka `m$r[k] => m[k] == 0`, that is, if `m[k]` was dead (as determined by our
 * instrumentation) then the value was 0 all along.
 *
 * The commands here are annotated with the [TACMeta.STORAGE_READ_TRACKER] meta to avoid triggering hooks.
