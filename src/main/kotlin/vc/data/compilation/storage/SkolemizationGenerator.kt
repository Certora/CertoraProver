/**
 * Generates map equality comparisons via skolemization. Note that this strategy *only* works if the storage comparison
 * is an equality comparison (it doesn't work for inequality) and if the equality is at a top level. It is the CVL
 * type checker's job to check this latter condition, and set the [spec.cvlast.ComparisonType.trySkolem]
 * field appropriately. However, even if that flag is set, if the storage comparison is an inequality, this class will
 * not be used.
 *
 * To assert two maps m1 and m2 are equal, this class generates the following (in pseudo-code):
 * ```
 * witness = *
 * e1 = m1[witness]
 * e2 = m2[witness]
 * assert e1 == e2
 * ```
 *
 * How does this work? Given the encoding of assertions as logical formulae, we ultimately assert that some property
 * of a program does *not* hold, and then look for unsatisfiability of that equation. In other words, we actually
 * check:
 * ```
 * witness = *
 * e1 = m1[witness]
 * e2 = m2[witness]
 * assert e1 != e2
 * ```
 * What does it mean if this formula is now unsatisfiable. That means that the SMT solver checked *every* possible
 * value of `witness` and coudln't find any possible value for which `m1[witness] != m2[witness]`. In other words,
 * at every single key/index, the value of m1 was the same at m2, that is, the maps were equal.
 *
 * This is not a novel encoding, and falls out of the fact that all top-level declarations are implicitly existentially
 * quantified, and from the fact that the negation of a forall is an exists. To come at this a different way,
 * we could encode the property directly as:
 * ```
 * assert forall witness.m1[witness] == m2[witness]`
 * ```
 * (and indeed, we do exactly this in the [QuantifierGenerator])
 * Recall however that we want the unsatisfiability of the negation of this assertion, so we get:
 * ```
 * assert !forall witness.m1[witness] == m2[witness]
 * ```
 * which is equivalent to
 * ```
 * assert exists witness.m1[witness] != m2[witness]
 * ```
 * An exists like this can be lifted to an assign havoc (this is the "skolemization" part), yielding:
 * ```
 * witness = *
 * assert m1[witness] != m2[witness]
 * ```
 * Which is what we are indeed generating.
 *
 * The benefit of doing this encoding directly ourselves (instead of relying on the quantifier grounding pass)
 * is twofold:
 * 1. It can work even if the user turns off grounding for some reason
 * 2. We can directly encode information into the generated code (via [SnippetCmd]) to show nicer counterexamples
 *
 * Q: Why doesn't this direct encoding work with inequality?
 * A: Short answer: because inequality ultimately turns into a forall (instead of an exists) which means
 * we can't use the same trick.
 *
 * Long answer: let's try it, and see what we're ultimately asking the solver to do:
 * ```
 * witness = *
 * e1 = m1[witness]
 * e2 = m2[witness]
 * assert e1 == e2
 * ```
 *
 * What does it mean if the solver gives us a SAT result here. It means that the solver was able to find a *single*
 * index/key at which the maps had the same value. Does that mean the assertion is violated? Not necesarily,
 * just because the maps had the same value at a single index, that doesn't mean that the maps aren't unequal. For example,
 * if every other index besides `witness` had different value, then clearly the maps are overall unequal. Put another way, to show two
 * maps are unequal you need only find a single index at which they differ, to show they are equal you have to
 * show they *must* be the same at *all* indices (this is the forall vs exists problem mentioned above);
 * recall that we invert the users condition in smt encoding, which is why for a user-level assertion about equality
 * we look for a proof of inequality, and vice versa for user-level assertion about inequality.

     * Generic version of skolemized map comparison.
     * [p] is a list of the tags to be used for the skolemized parameters to the maps being compared, which are
     * passed in via [m1] and [m2]. The result of these map lookup must have the same "type", which is
     * given by [elemTag]. The result of the comparison (which must be equality, see above) is stored in [outputVar].
     * The actual reading of an element out of [m1] and [m2] are delegated to [gen]. This function takes:
     * 1. a list of skolemized variables (which is guanranteed to be the same artiy as [p], and where
     * each variable has the tag in the corresponding position in [p])
     * 2. the base map (one of [m1] or [m2]), and
     * 3. the output variable to hold the value read out of the map. This output variable is guaranteed to have
     * the tag [elemTag].
     *
     * Then [gen] function must return a single command: it may not introduce new variables or other commands.
     *
     * Generating snippet commands for counter example display is delegated to [genAnnot], a function which
     * takes:
     * 1. The list of skolemized parameters (guaranteed to be the same as those passed to [gen] and satisfying the same properties)
     * 2. The variable which holds the value read out of [m1]
     * 3. The variable which holds the value read out of [m2]
     *
     * We don't pass along [outputVar] or [m1] or [m2] because it is assumed that the caller, having passed those parameters
     * to this function, has access to those variables in the scope which declares the callback function.
     *
     * The callback should return whatever commands are necessary to record counter example information in snippets,
     * introducing new variables/BIFs as necessary.
     *
     * The result of these operations are concatenated together and returned.
