 * This implements a Conditional Constant Propagation dataflow analysis
 * and transformation pass.  Here are several references about CCP:
 * https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2021sp/lectures/23ccp/lec23-sp19.pdf (shortest / fastest to read)
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_conditional_constant_propagation
 * https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/531Pages/f11/Resources/Papers/cprop.pdf
 *
 * Essentially, CCP improves over constant
 * propagation and constant folding by also taking control flow into
 * account. When a branching condition can be rewritten as a constant,
 * CCP will also use only the always-taken branch to determine the values
 * of variables asigned under the branch. For example,
 *
 * x = 3;
 * if (x == 5) {
 *     y = x + 12
 * } else {
 *     y = 0
 * }
 * z = y + 1
 *
 * would be simplified to
 * x = 3
 * y = 17
 * z = 18
 *
 * whereas a conventional constant propagation pass will not take the constant
 * branch into account.
 *
 * Notably, after this pass has run, it will leave behind many assignments
 * to variables that are no longer live, so a live variable analysis should
 * be redone after this pass. For this specific instance of CCP, it will also
 * leave behind many commands simplified to:
 * - `assume true`
 * - unconditional jumps to a branch only reachalbe from this unconditional jump
 * As a result this pass will be followed by calls to optimizations
 * that address these.
 *
 * For a complete description of how this works, see the links. In short,
 * it is a DFA with a state that tracks both: 1) a mapping from variables
 * to an abstract interpretation which is either a constant or under/over
 * defined, and 2) whether a command is reachable or not. Reachability
 * is taken into account when assigning abstract valuations to variables.
 *
 * This version of CCP has some tweaks to adapt to TAC. Importantly:
 * 1) In this case, because it is an assembly-like language involving
 * conditional jumps to labels / block identifiers, the part of the abstract
 * state used to track reachability needs to be adapted. Usually, it is
 * just a single bool tracking whether or not the command is reached.
 * In this case, since blocks may not be immediate successors of the
 * jump command, the analysis dynamically controls which commands to process
 * or skip -- provably unreachable commands re not processed at all, and
 * the state is mapped to Null for these.
 * 2) Because this language also defines valuations of variables with assumes,
 * these are also used to populate the valuations of variables when the assumed
 * expressions involve equality.
