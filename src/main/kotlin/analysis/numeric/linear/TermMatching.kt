         * Finding r for the purposes of match (which is decomposed into localNum and localDenom) is crucial to the
         * matching, and it is what we try to resolve first. Further, as matching variable wildcards is done through blind enumeration of
         * assignments, which requires m^n operations (m is the number of variables
         * in the linear term, and n is the number of wildcards), we eagerly match on exact variables, thereby minimizing m
         * (i.e., the number of candidates to try for each wildcard).
         *
         * In the following, (1), (2) etc. denote major steps of the algorithm which are marked later in the code
         *
         * Thus, we partition the terms ki * vi in this pattern into those where vi is exact vs symbolic terms (1).
         * We then iterate through the exact variables, seeing if the variable is mentioned in our target (2). If it is not,
         * we can bail out early. Otherwise, we check its factor ki (3). If it is constant, then we can either resolve
         * r (as r = a / ci, where a is the coefficient in [other_]) (4), or determine there is no possible value for
         * r (r * a != ci) (5). Otherwise, we save the wildcard factor for later resolution (6).
         *
         * After processing all exact terms, we try to find vsub by enumerating all possibilities. This takes the form
         * of a loop that tries different possible assignments, and tries to find a "contradiction", i.e., an assignment
         * of Wi -> xi such that r * a != ki. Note that, by design, we only start resolving factor wildcards after determining
         * r (if we find this isn't possible, we declare the pattern is ambiguous and refuse to produce a match). In other words,
         * by the time we are trying to assign a wildcard variable to a concrete variable in [other_], we must have r, which means
         * we can immediately discover such contradictions and fail early.
         *
         * The loop is pretty gnarly (it was written with the expectation this is called in several tight loops), so it is
         * documented elsewhere.
         *
         * After a "satisfying" wildcard assignment is found, we resolve the wildcards found in step 6 above (7). Note that,
         * if during the resolution of wildcards we discovered a value for r (8), this r could contradict some of
         * symbolic factors found in (6), so we can still still backtrack at this point. (9)
         *
         * This matcher returns eagerly, and will not enumerate multiple possible matches.
         *
         * Why do we canonicalize above? Well, it actually gives us that localDenom above must always be 1 for any r.
         * Why? by the definition of canonicalization, k and the coefficients of other must share no common factors
         * besides 1. suppose we had some localDenom > 1, and (localNum / localDenom) is fully reduced,
         * and (localNum / localDenom) * m gives an integer for all
         * m in codom(other.term) or m == other.k. But this means that localDenom divides localNum * m for all such m.
         * Because localNum / localDenom is fully reduced, localNum contains none of the prime factors of localDenom, meaning
         * that all of localDenoms prime factors must appear in m.
         * Thus localDenom must be a divisor for all such m, but after canonicalization the gcd of all m in other
         * must be one. Thus, localDenom will always be one!
