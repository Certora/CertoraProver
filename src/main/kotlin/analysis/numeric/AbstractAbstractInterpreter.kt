/**
 * An abstract starting point for an abstract interpreter. Steps the subset
 * of a whole-analysis state [W] given by [S]
 *
 * The basic implementation fills in the framework of step, which is implemented as:
 * + s' = [project] (w) (where w represents the entire abstract state, and is of type [W])
 * + s'' = [killLHS] (s') (to allow lazily closing abstract domains when information is about to be lost)
 * + s''' = [statementInterpreter]  . [IStatementInterpreter.stepCommand] (s'') (to model the effects of the statement
 * + return [postStep] (s''') (to allow any final cleanups, sanity checks, closing, etc.)
 *
 * In addition, the [propagate] function simply forwards to [IPathSemantics.propagate] in the [pathSemantics]
 *
 * Thus, most of the work is done by the two abstract fields, [statementInterpreter] and [pathSemantics]
