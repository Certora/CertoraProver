/**
 * Detects and rewrites overflow checks via pattern matching. It assumes normalization of the TAC via
 * [BoolOptimizer], [ConstantPropagatorAndSimplifier], [BlockMerger], [PatternRewriter.earlyPatternsList] (needs only some of the
 * patterns there), [GlobalInliner] (needed for renaming all aliasing variables with the same name, and for getting
 * vyper memory read-writes out of the way), and [NegationNormalizer]. It then also needs just a bit more of
 * normalization via [JumpLeNormalizer].
 *
 * The rewrite of the no-overflow condition has some subtle points explained here. Examples are with unsigned
 * multiplication, but it's the same with technical differences for the other cases.
 *
 * When the overflow conditions are with assumes it’s pretty straightforward. If the original code is (doesn't matter
 * if the assumes are before or after the multiplication:
 * ```
 *    res := x Mul y
 *    assume cond1
 *    assume cond2
 * ```
 * We turn it to (let’s say we detected this is an 8-bit unsigned multiplication):
 * ```
 *    res := narrow(x IntMul y)
 *    assume noMulOverflow(x, y)
 *    assume res <= 255
 * ```
 * The order of commands doesn’t matter.
 *
 * If the overflow conditions are jump-conditions, there are two cases. First if the conditions appear as pre-conditions
 * to the actual multiplication. Here is an example with three pre-blocks, it can anywhere from (1- 4):
 * ```
 * block1:
 *    <cmds1>
 *    jumpi (no overflow 1) to block2 else revertBlock1
 *
 * block2:
 *    <cmds2>
 *    jumpi (no overflow 2) to block3 else revertBlock2
 *
 * block3:
 *    <cmds3>
 *    jumpi (no overflow 3) to lastBlock else revertBlock3
 *
 * lastBlock:
 * ```
 *    ...
 *    r := original multiplication
 * ```
 *
 * It becomes:
 * ```
 * block1:
 *    <cmds1>
 *    <cmds2>
 *    <cmds3>
 *    cond1 := noOverflowBif(x, y)
 *    jumpi cond1 to operationBlock else (revertBlock1 or revertBlock2 or revertBlock3)
 *
 * operationBlock:
 *    result := narrow(x intMul y)
 *    cond2 := result <= 0xff
 *    jumpi cond2 to block1 else (revertBlock1 or revertBlock2 or revertBlock3)
 *
 * lastBlock:
 *    just erase the multiplication
 * ```
 *
 * The reason for having `operationBlock` is that it makes sure that the multiplication doesn’t overflow in the 2^256 sense,
 * if it does it would be wrong to use `safeMathNarrow` here, and we couldn’t do the more precise check.
 * The revert will non-deterministically jump to one of the revert blocks, this is a sound over-approximation.
 * If we ever see this gives us trouble, we can prevent the rewrite if the revert blocks are different (most of the
 * time they are equal).
 *
 * There are a couple of subtle points here:
 *   2. If the revert blocks (or blocks that follow) use any of the assignments in <cmds2> or <cmds3>, the effects of
 *      these assignments would be felt in `revertBlock1` as well. So we forbid such cases.
 *   3. similarly, if there is an assume in <cmds2> or <cmds3> (an assume is fine in <cmds1>), then again, the
 *      `revertBlock1` would have altered behavior.
 *
 * If the overflow conditions are post-multiplication:
 * ```
 * block1:
 *   <cmds1-a>
 * 	 result := x Mul y
 * 	 <cmds1-b>
 *   jumpi (no overflow 1) to block2 else revertBlock1
 *
 * block2:
 *   <cmds2>
 *   jumpi (no overflow 2) to block3 else revertBlock2
 *
 * block3:
 *   <cmds3>
 *   jumpi (no overflow 3) to lastBlock else revertBlock3
 *
 * lastBlock:
 *   <lastCmds>
 * ```
 *
 * from the commands after the multiplication we mark those that use `result`  (directly and indirectly). We first make
 * sure they are never used in any revert block (or blocks after it). But we only have to check until `lastBlock`,
 * because the multiplication and what follows will move there. The resulting rewrite is very similar to the above,
 * except for the pushing forward of all the commands that flow out of `result`.
 * ```
 * block1:
 *   <cmds1-a>
 * 	 <cmds1-b that don't use result>
 * 	 <cmds2 that don't use result>
 * 	 <cmds3 that don't use result>
 * 	 cond1 = noOverflowBif(x, y)
 * 	 jumpi cond1 to operationBlock else (revertBlock1 or revertBlock2 or revertBlock3)
 *
 * operationBlock:
 *   result := narrow(x IntMul y)
 *   cond2 := result <= 0xff
 *   jumpi cond2 to block1 else (revertBlock1 or revertBlock2 or revertBlock3)
 *
 * lastBlock:
 *   <result-using-cmds1-b>
 *   <result-using-cmds2>
 *   <result-using-cmds3>
 *   <lastCmds>
 * ```
 *
 * Similarly to the case where the checks originally appeared before the multiplication, here as well, we can't allow
 * assumes, as well as assignments to variables that are used in the revert blocks (or after), in <cmds2> and <cmds3>.
