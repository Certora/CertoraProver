    /**
     * A simple transformation to dedup our recipes (and so making the matcher have less patterns to match).
     * It already assumes there are no "greater-than" comparison , and that none of the "less-than" comparisons are
     * negated.
     *
     * The only thing that remains, is to turn an `Lt` to an `Le` when it's used in a jump condition:
     * ```
     * x := a < b
     * if (x) jump to block1 else to block2
     * ```
     * to
     * ```
     * y := b <= a
     * if (y) jump to block2 else to block1
     * ```
     * For example, if the pattern to prove no-overflow is indeed `b <= a`, we'd match it here even if it appears
     * reversed. This is not a problem if no-overflow is stated via assumes, because then, by previous normalization
     * (specifically no gt, no ge, and no negation normalization), we'll see:
     * ```
     * assume b <= a
     * ```
     * but can't see the equivalent:
     * ```
     * assume !(a < b)
     * ```
