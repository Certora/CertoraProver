         * [toTrace] can ultimately hold a constant value `k` assigned in [infeasibleAssign], AND that
         * we know [toTrace] having that value is infeasible (because, e.g., we explicitly assume later that `toTrace != k`)
         * we can prune branches/blocks encountered during tracing.
         *
         * The [traceMode] tells us exactly what we can prune and when. If [traceMode] is [TraceMode.TO_INITIAL_ASSIGN],
         * then it means we are tracing back to an assignment which is *not* a definite assignment for [toTrace].
         * Thus, the path from [start] to [infeasibleAssign] must be unconditional; if it is not unconditional, then we don't know that
         * [infeasibleAssign] is prunable. For example, consider the following:
         *
         * ```
         * if(*) {
         *    x := k
         *  } else {
         *    x := j
         *  }
         *  assume x != k;
         * ```
         *
         * In the above, the path from `x := k` to `assume x != k` is unconditional (of course, the path to `x := k` from
         * the root of the program is conditional, that's fine). Thus, we know that the `x := k` assignment is infeasible;
         * if it is executed, then we know that [toTrace] will ultimately hold a constant value (in this case, k) at [start]
         * which is impossible.
         *
         * Consider now if the path was conditional, as in the following:
         *
         * ```
         * if(*) {
         *   x := k
         *   if(*) {
         *     x := c
         *   }
         * } else {
         *    x := j
         * }
         * assume x != k;
         * ```
         *
         * Then we can't (definitively) say the `x := k` assignment can't happen, it may (or may not) be overwritten
         * by `x := c`. (A more powerful analysis could, e.g., conclude that the condition that gates the assignment
         * `x := c` MUST occur, but this is out of reach for now).
         *
         * In other words, [TraceMode.TO_INITIAL_ASSIGN] means that one of the assignments for [toTrace] at [start] could
         * be [infeasibleAssign], which is impossible. If we can show that [infeasibleAssign] must flow to start without
         * any intervening writes, we can prune [infeasibleAssign].
         *
         * That's [TraceMode.TO_INITIAL_ASSIGN], what about the other cases? [TraceMode.TO_DOMINATING_ASSIGN] means that
         * we are tracing back to an assignment that MUST occur, i.e., [infeasibleAssign] is the single, definite assignment
         * that gives the value of [toTrace] at [start] (and we know this assignment should be impossible).
         *
         * Then, any branches that occur along the path from [infeasibleAssign] to [start] should be pruned. For example:
         * ```
         * x := k
         * if(y == z) {
         *   if(i == j) {
         *      assume x != k
         *   }
         * }
         * ```
         * We must have that `x != k`, but x MUST equal k if we have that `y == z` and `i == j`. Thus, these branches cannot
         * be true, and we can thus prune those branches. Note that we cannot do a similar optimization for the [TraceMode.TO_DOMINATING_ASSIGN],
         * because we aren't sure that x must be `k` along the path we are tracing (although an extension of this analysis **could**
         * find a point at which the infeasible assignment becomes a must assignment, and then begins pruning branches).
         *
         * [TraceMode.TO_CONDITIONALLY_REACHED_DOMINATING_ASSIGN] means that we are tracing a path to a dominating, must
         * assignment which has traversed one or more conditional branches. If we reach the infeasible assignment in
         * this mode, we *cannot* prune the infeasible assignment itself: we cannot say the assignment definitely can't happen,
         * merely the conditional branches that lead from the assignment to [start] that were encountered along the trace.
         * In our example above, we will reach `x := k` in this tracing mode, indicating that `x := k` is still feasible,
         * and cannot be pruned: it is only infeasible if `y == z` and `i == j` are ALSO true, which is precisely why
         * we prune those branches.
         *
         * Note that we can still prune conditional branches encountered along the trace to [infeasibleAssign] in this mode, it simply
         * indicates we can't continue pruning once we reach [infeasibleAssign].
