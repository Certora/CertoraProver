     * Explanation on FullResolved callee:
     * If calleeresolution is CalledContract.FullyResolved:
     * If the sighash (i.e., summ.sigResolution is not empty) is also resolved, then the (delegate) call
     * would be inlined, and you would not see a CallSummary command, but instead,
     * a PUSH annotation that marks the start of the callee function.
     * Otherwise, if the sighash is unresolved (i.e., summ.sigResolution is empty), then you will have a CallSummary.
     * Cases for which delegateErrorVar is updated:
     * The callee is unresolved (null or SymbolicInput)
     * sighash is empty && (calleeresolution is fullyresolved and equal to THIS)
     *
     * Examples:
     * this.delegateCall(symbolic unresolved) or this.delegateCall("unresolved function") - calleeresolution is
     * FullyResolved.ConstantAddress
     * <known other contract>.resolved - null calleeresolution. sigresolution.length == 1.
     * 1. byAddressContract.delegatecall(calls['i']) - sighash empty, calleeresolutionis FullyResolved.storageLink.
     * 2. _addr.delegatecall(calls['i']) where _addr, calls unresolved - sighash empty, callresolution null
     * 3. callee.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("addBalance(address)", receivers['i'])) callee unresolved -
     *    sighash.size==1 calleeresolution symbolicInput.
     * 4. _addr.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("doDelegated()") - sighash.size==1, calleeresolution - symbolic
     * fallback - calleeresolution StorageLink(contractId=<int>)
     * 5. address(this).delegatecall(calls['i']) - sighash empty, calleesummary fullyresolved.constantaddress
     * 6. address(this).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("doDelegate(address)", receivers['i'])) - doDelegate not in
     * the contract and considered external by cvt. sigresolution.size==1, calleeresolution is FullyResolved.SelfLink.
     * Should give an error because it will fall to the fallback.
     * For this case no update to the error:
     * address(this).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("addBalance(address)", receivers['i'])) - addBalance resolved
     *  no summary.
     *  todo:
     *  Support delegate calls to functions that are not in the contract. Currently we check if a resolved function is
     *  payable so if it is not payable and not in the contract an error will not be given. This is in order to avoid
     *  false possitives for non payable functions in the contract when the callee is symbolic.
     *  However, in case the called function is not in the contract the run will get to the fallback.
     *  If the delegate call is in a loop and the fallback is payable an error should be issued but is currently not.
     *  We need to have special handling for this case.
