/**
 * This checker checks for existence of view reentrancy vulnerability.
 * For that it checks that for every public view function of the main contract, the result of the view function after
 * an unresolved call is either equal to the result of the view function at the start of the rule or to the result of
 * the view function at the end of the rule.
 * There are two ways to check this depending of the flag -exhaustiveViewReentrancy.
 * 1. Exhaustive - add an assert for each pair of view functions that checks the above holds for the two view functions.
 * This checks what we want because assume for a given unresolved call we have the list of all the view functions that
 * are equal to the result at start followed by all functions that are equal at the end, then there is the pair of
 * functions in which one if from the start and one from the end.
 * 2. The default - check the above holds for all view function in the same assert.
