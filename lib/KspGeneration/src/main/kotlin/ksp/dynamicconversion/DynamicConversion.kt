 * `T.Companion.constructFrom(Map<String,Any>): T` that constructs a new object
 * from such a map.

 * be convertible in one of the following ways:

 *   `Int` (see [convert]).
 * - the property is annotated with `@ConvertibleWith(Conv::class)` and `Conv`
 *   is derived from [DynamicConverter] with the appropriate type and provides
