/**
 * "Promotes" all method variables declared within the rule to be method parameters.
 * The advantage is that from this point forward we no longer need to consider the case of method variables.
 * For example - this case doesn't need to be handled in the [CVLCompiler].
 * Another advantage is that if we want to add internal filters to parametric methods, we will now be able to handle
 * filters for method variables in a transparent way.
