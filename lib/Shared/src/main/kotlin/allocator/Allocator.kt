/**
 *
 * On Extension classes:
 *
 * The following annotations describe the mechanisms by which so-called "extension classes" are generated. Extension classes
 * are designed to add functionality to a class declarations without being able to modify class declarations.
 *
 * Extension classes are generated within special source files that are generally not available except at compilation time
 * after the KSP framework has run and generated them. Thus, it is difficult (if not impossible?) to reliably access the
 * code generated within these extension classes "by name" within code.
 *
 * Thus, the extension class functionality described here relies on some conventions. When "extending" a class C with some
 * functionality, the code is placed in a class `C$Name` (in the same package as C)
 * where `Name` is the "sub-name" of the extension class that is appropriately descriptive name of the functionality
 * being implemented. These classes by convention have a single, static method called `impl` which provides the implementation
 * of the funtionality being added.
 *
 * For convenience, the [vc.data.ExtensionGetter] interface provides a mixin which allows easy (refelctive)
 * access to the extension method for a class `C`. When pulled into a class C, calling `c.getExtensionMethod(Name)` gets
 * the `impl` method defined in the extension class `C$Name`. NB that the Method returned by this function is static, and
 * thus its first argument must always be null.

/**
 * Eligible classes annotated with this field will have an "extension class" generated which supports consistent
 * remapping of auto-generated IDs that appear within this class' state.
 * An eligible class is a data class with at least one field that:
 * 1. Has any Int valued field annotated with [GeneratedBy], or
 * 2. Has a field whose type is annotated with [GenerateRemapper]
 * 3. Has a field whose types implements [vc.data.UniqueIdEntity]
 * 4. Has a field whose type is Map<K, V>, where V satisfies one of these requirements
 *
 * If a data class is found to have a field whose type has this annotation, and it itself is not annotated
 * with [GenerateRemapper] or [SuppressRemapWarning], compilation will fail with an error.
 *
 * However, if one of the types of fields the annotated class is found to satisfy the following:
 * a. It does not satisfy one of the conditions 1 - 4 above, AND
 * b. It is a parameterized type, the arguments of which satisfy conditions a & b
 * The generation process will conservatively fail with an error, is the remapper will refuse to generate
 * what it considers to be an incomplete remapper.
 *
 * The extension class mechanism cannot add methods directly to a class annotated with [GenerateRemapper].
 * Users of this can easily use the generated extension class by implementing the [vc.data.RemapperEntity]
 * interface.
 *
 * The extension class is given the name Remapper. The generated method expects two arguments: an object
 * of the type annotated by this annotation, and a remap function with the signature `(Any, Int, () -> Int) -> Int`.
 * See the [vc.data.UniqueIdEntity] documentation for the meaning of this function.
 *
 * Annotating an ineligible class with this annotation will result in a compilation error.

annotation class GenerateRemapper

/**
 * Classes annotated with this annotation will have an extension class generated which supports consistently remapping
 * [tac.MetaKey] value pairs according to the [GeneratedBy] annotation.
 *
 * The generated extension class is given the "sub-name" "MetaMap". The extension function expects three arguments:
 * 1. A [tac.MetaKey],
 * 2. The Int value corresponding to this meta key, and
 * 3. A remapper function with the signature `(Any, Int, () -> Int) -> Int`, whose interpretation is as given in the
 * [vc.data.UniqueIdEntity].
 *
 * As with [GenerateRemapper], this extension function is not easily accessible directly, and should be
 * accessed with [vc.data.ExtensionGetter]

@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class GenerateMetaMapper

/**
 * Annotates an Int field or a MetaKey as being generated by the corresponding allocator sequence [by].
 *
 * When applied to an Int field within a data class, this annotation serves two purposes:
 * 1. It indicates that it is an error for the containing data class to neither implement [vc.data.UniqueIdEntity] nor
 * have the [GenerateRemapper] annotation
 * 2. If the data class containing this field is annotated with [GenerateRemapper], the generated remapper will automatically
 * remap this field.
 *
 * When applicated to a MetaKey field, it indicates that values associated with that meta key are to be remapped consistently,
 * via the [GenerateMetaMapper] functionality. In order for the remapping process to work, the following conditions must hold:
 * 1. The MetaKey field being annotated must be explicitly annotated with the type `MetaKey<Int>`
 * 2. The MetaKey field must be "statically addressable", i.e., it must be declared in a singleton object
 *
 * If either of these two conditions is not met, compilation will fail with an error.
